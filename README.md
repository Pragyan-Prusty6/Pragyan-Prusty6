## About Me 💻🎨🪄

I'm a web developer with a passion for creativity and innovation. I have done my graduation in Computer Science and IT. I love building visually appealing and user-friendly web applications using modern technologies like Angular, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my spare time, I enjoy painting, exploring new design trends, and experimenting with different coding techniques.
